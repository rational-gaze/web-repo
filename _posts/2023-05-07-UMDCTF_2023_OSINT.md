Since OSINT is one of my very favorite ways of obtaining information and I am fascinated by the community and results that could be achieved, I have participated in the geolocation OSINT challenges - mainly `Gone Missing 1-3`. As a bonus, I am adding a writeup of a very nice forensics challenge `Fire Type Pokemon Only`.

## Gone Missing 1 - OSINT

All of the 3 OSINT challenges are hosted on <https://gone-missing.chall.lol/>. They follow gamified geolocation challenges, such as Geoguesser - we see a Google Maps image taken directly from the API and a small minimap where we click and get response whether we hit the spot or not. 

In the first challenge, we are presented with this picture. ![Gone Missing 1](/assets/img/2023_05_07_UMDCTF_2023_OSINT/gonemissing1.png){: .w-100 .normal}

Luckily for me, this building reminded me of something, I have seen that in my life already. I had a suspicion that this is Det kongelinge slott, the King's palace in Oslo. However I needed to make sure I am right and also find the exact spot where the picture was taken. I printscreened the building and used Google reverse image search to confirm my suspicion. Google results confirmed my suspicion and I went to Google Maps to find the exact spot. This was not very difficult to do since we see that the picture was taken from the grass on the right side of the park. Going through the 5 different pictures, I found the correct spot - the most distant on the right side.

After clicking on the map on the exact spot, I was presented with the flag.

## Gone Missing 2 - OSINT

Second challenge present us with some sort of picture from a hike, potentially in America. Notice the flag and the star-shape. 

![Gone Missing 2](/assets/img/2023_05_07_UMDCTF_2023_OSINT/gonemissing2.png){: .w-100 .normal}
 
I immediately did a reverse image search and in the results, I noticed a very similar structure on top of a rock. The link was a Wikipedia page about Castle Rock, Colorado. ![Suspicion](/assets/img/2023_05_07_UMDCTF_2023_OSINT/castlerock.png){: .w-100 .normal}

The Wikipedia page contained only one picture and important information - the structure is called 'Castle Rock' and is located in city called 'Castle Rock'. Inventive. Nevertheless, I went to Google Maps and searched for Castle Rock, Colorado. I searched for a geomorphological structure called 'Castle Rock' in the 'Castle Rock' city, turned on Street View and searched for the same picture. It was the southern-most picture.

![Castle Rock found](/assets/img/2023_05_07_UMDCTF_2023_OSINT/castlerock_found.png){: .w-100 .normal}

Finding the same spot on the minimap, I was given the second flag.

## Gone Missing 3 - OSINT

Third challenge in the row and the hardest one. We are given only this panorama picture. I am splitting the panorama into 2 pictures. 

![Gone missing 3](/assets/img/2023_05_07_UMDCTF_2023_OSINT/gonemissing3.png){: .w-100 .normal}

![Gone Missing 3 2](/assets/img/2023_05_07_UMDCTF_2023_OSINT/gonemissing3_2.png){: .w-100 .normal}

There are several clues to notice:
- quite a new road with one yellow stripe in the middle
- banner on the lamp
- lamp plate number
- high-voltage electric power line crossing the forest and the road
- forest-ish area following the road
- possible mountains area in the background, very faintly visible

First, I focused on the banner. Since China has no Google Street View and Vietnam as well, my suspicion was Taiwan, however I needed to verify this claim. I searched via Google for an OCR that was able to translate Chinese letters and I found this website <https://2ocr.com/online-ocr-chinese/>. I printscreened the banner only and flipped vertically (because of the number 3 being mirrored) and uploaded to the website. The OCR created this monstrosity:
```
3 Fourth day, support Yunlin
Tran Government County
citizen county
Chan Sai Bin Ti MP
candidate
Dali
please support
It is common to be a farmer
be friends with workers
```

The word Yunlin was interesting. Quick search revealed that this is a Taiwanese county. Amazing, I have narrowed down the list of possibilities, however I still needed to verify that hypothesis. I started running through Google Maps to check whether lamps and roads like this even exist in Taiwan and started looking for high voltage power line and noticing lamp plate numbers. When zoomed-in, the plate number shown was `320479`. 

![Plate Number](/assets/img/2023_05_07_UMDCTF_2023_OSINT/platenumber.png){: .w-100 .normal}

I started on the western coast, used the Street View to find a lamp with a plate number and check against the one I had to find. The lamps on the eastern started with `1xxxxx` and as I was getting closer to the eastern part of the county, the row of numbers was rising. The area around Gukeng (the Gukeng Township) was swarming with plates `30xxxx` and `31xxxx`. Then I started to pay closer attention to the road and via Street View I have selected few roads that were good candidates - roads `202`, `154` and `158`.

![Roads](/assets/img/2023_05_07_UMDCTF_2023_OSINT/roads.png){: .w-100 .normal}

The only point missing was to find out the powerline crossing the road. For this I have used OSM (OpenStreetMap) and that leaved me with 2 options, both on the `158` road. 

![OSM Powerline](/assets/img/2023_05_07_UMDCTF_2023_OSINT/osm_powerline.png){: .w-100 .normal}

This way I have found out that the place is the first spot.

![Gukeng Found](/assets/img/2023_05_07_UMDCTF_2023_OSINT/gukeng_found.png){: .w-100 .normal}

After pointing to this place on the map, I was given the third and final flag.

## Fire Type Pokemon Only - Forensics

For this forensics challenge, I was given only a `.pcapng` file - that meant it will be a dig-the-data from the stream challenge. I opened the file in Wireshark and first thing I did was opening `Statistics -> Conversations` and looked on the `TCP` tab. I sorted the results by `port B` ascendingly. A lot of the conversations were made on `443/tcp` that most probably were there only to bloat the file and since this port is used mainly for `HTTPS` traffic, I decided to ignore it until I finished analysis of other ports. The first port I saw was `21/tcp` - that was really interesting to me due to the use of `FTP - File Transfer Protocol`, which is unencrypted. Therefore I decided to proceed with analysis of this stream. In the following image, notice the IP address and the `Port B` - this will give you a hint who is the server and who is the client.

![Conversations](/assets/img/2023_05_07_UMDCTF_2023_OSINT/wireshark_conversation.png){: .w-100 .normal}

I decided to use the display filter `ip.addr == 192.168.16.130 && (ftp || ftp-data || tcp.port == 21)` to list only the traffic going to or from the host `192.168.16.130` via `21/tcp` or labeled `ftp` or `ftp-data` in Wireshark. This display filter started showing packets from no. `11913`. Packet `11916` contains response from the server in which we read the technology and version - `vsFTPd 3.0.5`. Packet `12476` shows the user logging in - `pokemonfan1` and packet `12576` reveals the password of the user - `pika`.
> This is exactly the reason why you should never use `FTP` and other unenecrypted transfer protocols.
{: .prompt-warning }

In packet `12618`, we see first command that will send data to the client in form of the `ftp-data` label in Wireshark. That command is `LIST` - listing the files and folders in current working directory. Packet `12620` contains the actual response from the server:
```
drwxrwxr-x    2 1001     1001         4096 Apr 27 12:55 feet
drwxrwxr-x    2 1001     1001         4096 Apr 27 12:57 secret_documents
drwx------    3 1001     1001         4096 Apr 27 12:46 snap
```

We see 3 directories - `feet`, `secret_documents` and `snap`. Packet `14205` contains `CWD` request (change working directory) to `secret_documents` and packet `14277` contains the response for another `LIST` command of that directory.
```

```

We see only files in this directory, certain files have very interesting names and might be the objective of the challenge. After few file downloads in the packet capture, log-off and another log-on, we finally get to packet `28927` that contains `RETR` command for the file `secret`. That command is an abbreviation of word retrieve. Packet `28929` is the starting point of the transfer of the file. According to the directory listing, this file is bigger and thus it is split into multiple packets. 

Clicking on the packet `28929`, we see in the hexdump an interesting thing - a file called `wisdom.mp4`, most probably zipped.

![Wisdom.mp4](/assets/img/2023_05_07_UMDCTF_2023_OSINT/wisdom.png){: .w-100 .normal}

Here comes the amazing feature of Wireshark. Right-clicking on the packet `28929` and selecting `Follow -> TCP Stream`, we can reconstruct the whole retrieval of the file and save it on our disk. You will see a bunch of ASCII, however click on the `Show data as` - select `Raw` and give it a few seconds until the entire conversation is translated back into raw form. After that, just click on the `Save as` and save it to your computer.

![raw](/assets/img/2023_05_07_UMDCTF_2023_OSINT/raw.png){: .w-100 .normal}

I have saved the file as `wisdom` without any extension and to identify the file, I ran `file` command.

```bash
❯ file wisdom
wisdom: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compression method=deflate
```

That could confirm the file being an Zip archive, however `file` command is not always precise and CTF challenges are sometimes made to confuse this utility. Nevertheless, I ran the `unzip` command. That seemed to be working, however it asked me a password. I blindly tried the `pika` password that was used to access the FTP server and it worked!

```bash
❯ unzip wisdom
Archive:  wisdom
[wisdom] wisdom.mp4 password: 
  inflating: wisdom.mp4  
```

I opened the video file and the flag was in the right bottom corner visible.
